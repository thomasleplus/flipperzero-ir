# Flipper Zero IR

The Infrared (IR) files that I created using my Flipper Zero to backup my devices' remote controls.

If you are looking for large collections of IR files (including mine), I recommend either the official
[IRDB](https://github.com/flipperdevices/IRDB) from Flipper Devices or
the larger unofficial
[Flipper IRDB](https://github.com/Lucaslhm/Flipper-IRDB).
